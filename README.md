# AraBERT-LSTM_Model

Cyberbullying in Arabic will be detected through a specific input dataset we have collected and cleaned for this project. The main steps of the process include data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and finally, ensemble prediction to combine results from multiple models into a unified prediction. These steps collectively ensure the development of a robust and effective system for cyberbullying detection. During preprocessing, we will remove unnecessary text to clean the data. In the features extraction step, the textual data is transformed into a suitable format to feed into the deep learning algorithm. The extracted features are fed into a classification algorithm for training in the classification step. We will use the Hybrid AraBERT+LSTM model.
